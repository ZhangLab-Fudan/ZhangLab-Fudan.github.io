Dr. Zhao Zhang
======
Principal Investigator (PI) in Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University.

Experience
======
1. Ph.D. Bioinformatics, Fudan University (2016)
2. Postdoc, University of Texas Health Science center at Houston (UThealth, 2021)

Research Interests
======
We focus on **dynamic alterations of regulatory elements** in large-scale cohorts and **complex diseases** using cutting-edge **bioinformatics** algorithms and biotechnologies. 
Recent research includes: 
1. Characterizing regulatory elements, such as eRNAs and histone modifications, across species, tissues, and cancer types, and uncovering their potential utility in clinical treatments (Nature Commutations, 2019; Nucleic Acids Research 2021, 2022; Cancer Research, 2022, Advanced Science, 2023).
2. Utilizing pan-cancer analyses to understand key factors in tumorigenesis and aid in drug development (The Innovations, 2023; Genome Medicine, 2020; RNA Biology, 2019; Communications Biology, 2018; Clinical epigenetics, 2021).
We have been invited to contribute reviews, commentaries, and spotlights to multiple journals, including *Nature Biotechnology*, *Trends in Genetics*, *Trends in Molecular Medicine*, *Trends in Cancers and Oncogene*. To date, we have published approximately 50 peer-reviewed papers with a total citation count nearing 2000.
