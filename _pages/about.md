Dr. Zhao Zhang
======
Assistant Professors (PI) in Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University.

Experience
======
1. Ph.D. Bioinformatics, Fudan University (2016)
2. Postdoc, University of Texas Health Science center at Houston (UThealth, 2021)

Research Interests
======
We focus on **dynamic alternations of regulatory elements** in large scale cohort and **complex diseases** using cutting-edge **bioinformatical** algorithm and biotechniques. 
Recent researches including: 
1. Characterized regulatory elements such as eRNA and histone enzymes across species, tissues and cancer types, and uncover their potential utility in development and clinical treatment (Nature Commutations, 2019; Nucleic Acids Research 2021, 2022; Cancer Research, 2022, Advanced Science, 2023).
2. Using pan-cancer analyses to understand key factors in tumorigenesis and aid to drug developments (The Innovations, 2023; Genome Medicine, 2020; RNA Biology, 2019; Communications Biology, 2018; Clinical epigenetics, 2021).
We have invited to contribute to review, commentary and spotlight by multiple journals, including, *Nature Biotechnology*, *Trends in Genetics*, *Trends in Molecular Medicine*, *Trends in Cancers and Oncogene*. We have published about 50 peer-reviewed papers with total citation near 2000.
