Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) play critical roles in multiple regulatory processes, including transcription, post-transcription, and translation. Emerging evidence reveals the critical roles of sncRNAs in cancer development and their potential role as biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets. In this paper, we review recent research on four sncRNA species with functional significance in cancer: small nucleolar RNAs, transfer RNA, small nuclear RNAs, and piwi-interacting RNAs. We introduce their functional roles in tumorigenesis and discuss the potential utility of sncRNAs as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We further summarize approaches to characterize sncRNAs in a high-throughput manner, including the specific library construction and computational framework. Our review provides a perspective of the functions, clinical utility, and characterization of sncRNAs in cancer.
