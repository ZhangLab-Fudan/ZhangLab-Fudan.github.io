Full-length circular RNAs are sequenced at high throughput using nanopores.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) in eukaryotes number in the millions, and the list of their biological functions continues to grow1. Yet the full-length sequences of most circular RNAs are unknown. Short-read sequencing can identify circRNAs from signatures of the back-splicing reactions that create them, but it usually cannot recover their full-length sequences2. Long-read sequencing, which can more easily distinguish circular RNAs from similar linear RNAs, promises to overcome this limitation. Writing in Nature Biotechnology, Zhang et al.3 use optimized nanopore sequencing and a new algorithm, CIRI-long, to reconstruct the complete sequences of circRNAs at high throughput. This state-of-the-art approach, together with another recent method4, can sequence full-length circRNAs with high efficiency and accuracy, opening new opportunities to understand their biogenesis and functions.
