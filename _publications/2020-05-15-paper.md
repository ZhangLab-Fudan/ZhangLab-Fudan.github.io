title: "Spheroids Propel Tumor Characterization"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-05-15-paper
excerpt: 'Determining the functions of cancer driver genes in cancer models to mimic in vivo tumors has been a significant challenge. In a recent study, Han et al. implemented large-scale clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening in 3D lung cancer spheroids, revealing advantages of 3D spheroids over 2D monolayers, wherein novel therapeutic targets were identified, such as carboxypeptidase D (CPD).'
