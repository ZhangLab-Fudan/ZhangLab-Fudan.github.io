Abstract
Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) transcribed from enhancer regions, serve as a type of critical regulatory element in gene expression. There is increasing evidence demonstrating that the aberrant expression of eRNAs can be broadly detected in various human diseases. Some studies also revealed the potential clinical utility of eRNAs in these diseases. In this review, we summarized the recent studies regarding the pathological mechanisms of eRNAs as well as their potential utility across human diseases, including cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases and metabolic diseases. It could help us to understand how eRNAs are engaged in the processes of diseases and to obtain better insight of eRNAs in diagnosis, prognosis or therapy. The studies we reviewed here indicate the enormous therapeutic potency of eRNAs across human diseases.
