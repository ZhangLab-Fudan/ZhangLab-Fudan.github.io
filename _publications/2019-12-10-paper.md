excerpt: 'Spliceosomes comprise small nuclear (sn)RNAs and proteins. Through genome-wide analyses in large-scale tumor samples, recent studies by Shuai et al., Suzuki et al., and Inoue et al. have identified recurrent spliceosomal mutations that induced genome-wide splicing alterations of cancer-related genes to promote malignancy. These discoveries suggest novel RNA-based therapeutics in anticancer treatment.'
